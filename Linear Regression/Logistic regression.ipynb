    "### logistic regression\n",
    "In statistics, logistic regression, or logit regression is a regression model where the dependent variable is `categorical`. It covers the case of a binary dependent variableâ€”that is, where the output can take only two values, \"0\" and \"1\" <br \\>\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary logistic model is used to estimate the probability of a binary response based on one or more predictor (or independent) variables (features). It allows one to say that the presence of a risk factor increases the odds of a given outcome by a specific factor. The model is a direct probability model and not a classifier.\n",
